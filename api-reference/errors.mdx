The StreamSkill API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted), and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with StreamSkill's servers.

In case of an error, the API will return an error response with a JSON object containing the following fields
(But some errors provide additional fields):
- `name` - A human-readable name of the error.
- `message` - A human-readable message describing the error.
- `code` - Almost always is 0.
- `status` - Status code of the error.
- `type` - Type of error that was returned. (e.g. `bad_request_http_exception`)

## Error codes

| Code  | Description                                                                                            |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `400` | Bad Request - The request was invalid or cannot be served. (e.g., invalid JSON)                        |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Unable to authenticate.                                                                 |
| `402` | Insufficient Funds - You don't have enough funds to do the request.                                    |
| `404` | Not Found - The specified resource could not be found.                                                 |
| `405` | Method Not Allowed - Action is unavailable for this order.                                             |
| `409` | Purchase Done - Order already completed.                                                               |
| `422` | Validation Error - The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to validation errors. |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded.                                                               |
| `500` | Action failed - Action not performed.                                                                  |


## Rate-limits

Rate-limiting errors (`429`) happen when you are sending too many requests to the API.
All API endpoints are rate-limited, and currently, the rate limit is set to `30 req/m` (requests per minute).

Additionally, the API returns the following headers in the response:
- `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` - The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make in a minute.
- `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` - The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
- `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` - The time after which the rate limit window resets in seconds.
