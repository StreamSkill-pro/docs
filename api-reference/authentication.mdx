## Bearer Token

StreamSkill API uses Bearer authentication with your API Key. You will have to send your API Key via the Authorization header.

```
Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}
```

Your API key can be accessed and managed in your [Security](https://streamskill.pro/en/cabinet/sessions) tab.


### Secure your API key

<Warning>
    Because API keys are not associated with an IP address and do not expire, they must be handled with care and should not be disclosed to third parties.
</Warning>

Make sure to keep your API key secure. Do not share it in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so on.

We recommend using environment variables or secrets to store your API key.

<Note>
    If you suspect that your API key has been compromised, you can remove it in your [Security](https://streamskill.pro/en/cabinet/sessions) tab.
